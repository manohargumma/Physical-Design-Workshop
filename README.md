### `Calculation of Flop Ratio and DFF %`
![image](https://github.com/manohargumma/Physical-Design-Workshop/blob/43f24eaf0abd539ec71242c0b43fa55d21ebfd96/images/Screenshot%20from%202025-10-30%2022-10-02.png)

To evaluate the sequential logic content in the synthesized design:

- **Total Cells** = 14596
- **DFF Cells** = 1613 (from `sky130_fd_sc_hd__dfxtp_2`)

#### ‚û§ Flop Ratio:

Flop Ratio = DFFs / Total Cells = 1613 / 14596 ‚âà 0.11050972

#### ‚û§ DFF Percentage:

DFF % = (DFFs / Total Cells) √ó 100 = (1613 / 14296) √ó 100 ‚âà 11.050972%

###  Good floorplan vs bad floorplan and introduction to library cells



```shell
Utilisation Factor =  Area occupied by netlist
                     __________________________
                         Total area of core
                         

Aspect Ratio =  Height
               ________
                Width
```

**Pre-placed cells :** Pre-placed cells are essential functional blocks, such as memory, custom processors, and analog circuits, positioned manually in fixed locations. These blocks are crucial for the chip‚Äôs performance and remain fixed during placement and routing to preserve their functionality and layout integrity.

**Decoupling Capacitors :** Decoupling capacitors are placed near logic circuits to stabilize power supply voltages during transient events. Acting as local energy reserves, they help reduce voltage fluctuations, crosstalk, and electromagnetic interference (EMI), ensuring reliable power delivery to sensitive circuits.

**Power Planning:** A robust power planning strategy includes creating a power and ground mesh to distribute VDD and VSS evenly across the chip. This setup ensures stable power delivery, minimizes voltage drops, and improves overall efficiency. Multiple power and ground points reduce the risk of instability and voltage drop issues, supporting the design‚Äôs power needs effectively.

**Pin Placement:** Pin placement (I/O planning) is crucial for functionality and reliability. Strategic pin assignment minimizes signal degradation, preserves data integrity, and helps manage heat dissipation. Proper positioning of power and ground pins supports thermal management and enhances signal strength, contributing to overall system stability and manufacturability.

#### Step 5: Floorplaning using OpenLANE & view in Magic

```shell
run_floorplan
```
![image](https://github.com/manohargumma/Physical-Design-Workshop/blob/6a99f4af4366326d6d13c53980f368d50c861922/images/Screenshot%20from%202025-10-31%2019-21-45.png)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Potential Errors During Floorplanning**

When running:

```shell
run_floorplan
```
you may encounter errors, especially for macro-less designs like picorv32a. These errors are typically due to macro_placement steps within the OpenROAD flow that expect macros to be present in the design.

üß© **Why the Error Occurs?**
The script or_basic_mp.tcl, which handles macro placement, assumes that the design contains macros (like SRAMs or IPs). If no such macros are present, OpenROAD may crash or throw errors during this step:
```shell
macro_placement -global_config glb.cfg
```
For designs without any macros, this command should be skipped to avoid unnecessary failures.

üõ†Ô∏è **How to Fix It?**
You need to modify the or_basic_mp.tcl script to check whether the design contains macros, and only run macro_placement if macros are found.

‚úÖ This change ensures macro placement is only performed when necessary.

Replace the contents of:
```shell
/openLANE_flow/scripts/openroad/or_basic_mp.tcl
```

#### Step 6: Viewing the Floorplan DEF in Magic

To visually inspect the floorplan (DEF) file in the Magic layout editor, use the following command in your terminal from the floorplan results directory:

```shell
magic -T Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read picorv32a.floorplan.def &
```

- Press s and v to fit the layout properly on the screen.

- Move the cursor onto a particular object and then press s.

- Go to the tkcon main window.

- Type the command shown in the screenshot (or observe the details displayed).

- The tkcon window will show the details of the selected object.

#### Step 7: Run Placement using OpenLANE

After successful floorplanning, the next major step in the digital backend flow is cell placement. This stage involves arranging the standard cells within the defined core area while minimizing congestion, wire length, and optimizing performance metrics like timing and power.

To initiate placement:
```shell
run_placement
```
![image](https://github.com/manohargumma/Physical-Design-Workshop/blob/ea7869831e0f395a507fc7b91e3b585e9c59ecda/images/Screenshot%20from%202025-10-31%2009-12-50.png)



#### Step 8: Viewing the Placement DEF in Magic

```shell
magic -T  /home/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read picorv32a.placement.def &

### Viewing the Placement PNG Output

After running the placement step (`run_placement`), a visualization of the placed standard cells is automatically generated.

üìÅ You can find this file in the placement results directory:

To open this PNG file from the terminal (inside the appropriate directory), use:

```bash
xdg-open picorv32a.placement.def.png
```
